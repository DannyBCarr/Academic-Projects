I am writing to express my concerns regarding a significant safety issue with the dashboard of my Toyota Camry 2011 LXE, VIN: [XXX] . We purchased this vehicle brand new and have maintained it diligently over the years. However, we have never received any recall notices concerning this issue, despite the dealer's claim that they were sent. The problem we are experiencing with our vehicle's dashboard is a sticky and peeling surface. Over time, the dashboard's material has deteriorated, becoming sticky and disintegrating. This poses a hazardous situation while driving, affecting both the aesthetics of the vehicle and safety due to impaired visibility and potential distraction.  While I understand that Toyota has recognized this problem in other Toyota Camry vehicles and initiated a recall, our vehicle's VIN has been excluded from the recall list. We strongly believe that this issue is systemic and not confined to a specific range of VINs, and thus, our car should also be included in the recall.  We kindly request the NHTSA's assistance in ensuring that our concerns are addressed promptly. We urge you to investigate the matter further and encourage Toyota to extend the recall to include our vehicle and others facing a similar issue. It is crucial to uphold safety and quality standards for automobiles in the United States, prioritizing the well-being of drivers and passengers.  Furthermore, we would appreciate your guidance on the process to formally address this issue with Toyota. Our previous attempts to resolve the matter directly with the manufacturer have been unsuccessful, as they denied our request to include our vehicle in the recall. If you could provide information on the necessary steps to escalate our case or mediate with the manufacturer, it would be greatly appreciated.

ONCE IT FINDS THE CORRECT GEAR THE CAR WILL LUNGE VERY QUICKLY AND ALMOST CREATE REAR END COLLISIONS.  I HAVE TWO INTERSECTIONS NEAR MY HOME THAT I AM AFRAID TO COME TO BECAUSE I HAVE TO FLOOR THE GAS AND STEP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL SO THE CAR DOES NOT STALL AND SO THAT THE CAR WILL MAKE IT ACROSS THE INTERSECTION WITHOUT GETTING T-BONED.  I ALMOST GOT T-BONED TWICE DUE TO THIS THE LAST HAPPENING ON 6-30-12.  THIS ISSUE IS A 6-15 MPH ISSUE AND WHEN COLD MORE THAN WARMED UP.  I READ THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT A LEARNING TRANSMISSION AND THAT IT TRIES TO LEARN OPERATORS.  WITH 21,000 MILES A CAR SHOULD NOT BE LEARNING AND WHAT IF A DIFFERENT OPERATOR DRIVES IT?   THE CAR WILL JERK ME AROUND WHILE ON MY 8 MILE JAUNT TO THE HIGHWAY IN THE MORNINGS.  ONCE ON THE HIGHWAY THIS IS A NON-ISSUE.  I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL BUT I HAVE READ OF MANY OTHER TERRIFIED TOYOTA 2011 AND 2010 CAMRY OWNERS THAT HAVE CALLED THEM AND SEVERAL HAVE CONTACTED YOUR ORGANIZATION.  THERE IS A TSB (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN)  0287-10 OUT FOR THE LEARNING OF THIS TRANSMISSION BUT IT HAS NOT HELP MY SITUATION OR OTHERS FROM WHAT I READ.  (UPDATED TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE)    I WILL NOT ALLOW MY WIFE OR CHILDREN IN THIS CAR.  I EVEN TOOK THE KEYS WITH ME ONCE WHILE AWAY ON BUSINESS SO SHE WOULD NOT FORGET AND DRIVE IT.  *TR', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2011', 'productMake': 'TOYOTA', 'productModel': 'CAMRY', 'manufacturer': 'Toyota Motor Corporation'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10466245, 'manufacturer': 'Toyota Motor Corporation', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '07/02/2012', 'dateComplaintFiled': '07/19/2012', 'vin': '4T1BF3EK9BU', 'components': 'STRUCTURE,EQUIPMENT', 'summary': '2011 TOYOTA CAMRY.

HE SHOWED ME A MINISCULE SCRATCH ON THE PAINTED ALLOY RIM THAT HE THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT AREA.  I COULD HARDLY SEE IT AND IT WAS TOO SMALL TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED BY MY CAMERA.  HE ALSO SAID THE TIRE WAS SCUFFED SLIGHTLY BUT OF COURSE IT WAS SCUFFED AFTER THE BLOWOUT BY SUDDEN DEFLATION.  THE RIGHT REAR TIRE HE INDICATED ALSO HAD BEEN IMPACTED WHICH I COULD NOT SEE ANY APPARENT DAMAGE.  I SPOKE WITH FIRESTONE BY TELEPHONE AND THEY INDICATED THAT SINCE THE TECHNICIAN HAD REPORTED SIDEWALL DAMAGE THE WARRANTY WAS NO GOOD DUE TO IMPACT. QUITE FRANKLY, WE HAVE NOT HIT ANYTHING WITH EITHER TIRE NOR RUN OVER OR SCRAPED THE SIDEWALL ON CURBING.

WHEN THE THROTTLE SHUTS, THE TACH WILL SUDDENLY DROP ABOUT 150 RPM AND THE CAR NOTICEABLY DECELERATES. OFTEN, AFTER A FEW SECONDS, THE COMPUTER SEEMS TO REALIZE THAT THE THROTTLE SHOULDN'T BE ALL THE WAY OFF, AND COMMANDS THE ENGINE TO SPEED UP. ENGINE SPEED THEN JUMPS ABOUT 200 RPM, WITH AN ANNOYING SURGE AND DROPS BACK ABOUT 50 RPM A SECOND OR SO LATER.

THE TECHNICIANS ALSO DROVE THE CAMRY FOR 55 MILES, BUT THEY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPAIRS, DESPITE THE DTC CODES, BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAMRY, AND WE ARE TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT, BUT TOYOTA WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG.  THE DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES INDICATE OTHERWISE.  BASED ON RESEARCH WE DID, THE FIRST CODE C1249, INDICATES AN OPENING IN THE STOP LIGHT SWITCH CIRCUIT, WHICH RECOMMENDS THREE LIKELY CAUSES OF THE ERROR, 1) THE STOP LIGHT SWITCH, 2) STOP LIGHT SWITCH CIRCUIT, OR 3) THE BRAKE ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY (SKID CONTROL ECU).  THE SECOND CODE U0129 INDICATES TROUBLE WITH THE ABS AND TRACTION ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY (AS WELL AS THE SKID CONTROL ECU), OR THE CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING BECAUSE WHAT THIS ERROR MEANS IS THAT THE COMPUTER DISENGAGES THE BRAKES, WHICH IS CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED TO US.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TOLD US TO CONTACT CORPORATE; CORPORATE TOLD US TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP.  NO REPAIRS HAVE BEEN DONE, AND THE CAR IS JUST COLLECTING DUST NOW.  *TR\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2011', 'productMake': 'TOYOTA', 'productModel': 'CAMRY', 'manufacturer': 'Toyota Motor Corporation'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10357101, 'manufacturer': 'Toyota Motor Corporation', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '09/09/2010', 'dateComplaintFiled': '09/23/2010', 'vin': '4T1BF3EK9BU', 'components': 'SUSPENSION', 'summary': 'AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, MY NEW 2011 TOYOTA CAMRY VEERS LEFT.(PURCHASED 9/9/10)THE DEALER HAS ALIGNED IT TWICE, AND THE VEHICLE STILL VEERS LEFT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.

I RENTED IT FROM HERTZ AT THE DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  ON AUGUST 25, WHILE TRAVELING EAST ON US 70, ABOUT 10 MILES WEST OF FRISCO, COLORADO, THE CAR'S ENGINE STOPPED AND THE DASH WENT BLANK, NO WARNING OR ANYTHING.  THIS WAS VERY ANNOYING FOR MY PASSENGERS AND ME, GOING FROM 65-70 MPH TO -0- IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO PULL ON TO THE BERM AND OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING SEMIS, MOST OF WHOM WERE ABLE TO PULL INTO THE PASSING LANE.     I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THE CAR OVERHEATED AS I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR SEVERAL HOURS WITH THE AC ON AND THE ROAD IS A MOUNTAINOUS ROAD.  I LET THE CAR COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES, MADE SURE THE AC WAS OFF.  I STARTED THE CAR AND 'EVERYTHING' CAME TO LIFE.  I DROVE UP THE REMAINDER OF THE HILL, KEEPING THE SPEED AT APPROXIMATELY 55MPH, DOWN THE NEXT AND STARTED UP WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED ' COMPLETE LACK OF POWER.  AGAIN VERY ANNOYING!!!    AFTER THIS LAST EPISODE WE CALLED YOUR OFFICE AND WERE TOLD TO WAIT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A REPLACEMENT. AS WE HAD A SCHEDULED ENGAGEMENT IN FRISCO, AND A FRIEND WHO COULD DRIVE OUT 10 MILES TO PICK US UP, THE AGENT TOLD US TO LEAVE THE CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE AGENT SAID A CAR WOULD BE DELIVERED TO OUR HOTEL IN FRISCO.  THE CAR WAS DELIVERED TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER.      AND ONE MORE THING.  I AM NOT SURE BUT I THINK THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK THE FIRST STALL TIME.  I THINK THE CAR STARTED TO ROLL BACKWARD BEFORE I GOT IT FROM DRIVE TO PARK I WAS CAUGHT BY SURPRISE THE FIRST TIME AND A LITTLE SLOW TO REACT TO THE STALL.  THE SECOND TIME AS SOON AS IT STALLED I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE AND PUT IT INTO PARK.
